            </h3>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">$10.25 (tax is included) Small (8oz)</h3>
            <p class="note">TLDR; You pay for the experience, not the matcha. The matcha itself is nothing special, and I can't recommend it given the price.</p>
            <h2>THE MATCHA</h2>
            <h3>Menu</h3>
            <p>Setsugekka has many types of matcha for you to choose from, all at varying price points. You can get your matcha as usucha, koicha, latte (hot/iced), or Matcha-ppuccino (hot/iced). They <b>only use oat milk</b>, so if you can't have oat milk for any reason, keep that in mind. Of course, I got the iced matcha latte as per usual. The matcha I went with was the <i>Hana Matcha</i>, since it was the least expensive.</p>
            <h3>Pricing</h3>
            <p>Be aware that the price on the menu is of the matcha alone. There is an additional $1.50 charge for lattes plus 8.875% NY sales tax, taking the price from about $7 to &10.25.</p>
            <div class="map-key">
                <h3>Taste</h3>
                <p>Despite the rich green of the matcha, the Hana matcha didn't have a very strong matcha taste. It leans on the umami side of flavor, but you will mostly taste the oat milk rather than the matcha. There was a moment where I tasted hints of a rich nuttiness, but I really had to focus on what I was tasting since the flavors were so subtle. They seem to be very stingy with the amount of matcha they use while charging you premium prices. The small size is incredibly small (about 8oz) and they filled it to the brim with ice.</p>
                <p>The barista described the hana matcha as slightly umami and bitter at the end. I think this is an apt descriptor if you add in that the taste is very, very subtle.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>THE EXPERIENCE</h2>
            <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>I actually discovered this place via Reddit when I was searching for new places to review. Reddit really hyped up this place and a lot of people said 'you don't know matcha until you've had Setsugekka!' After having tried the matcha for myself, I can say Reddit definately over hyped it.</p>
            <p>I can see why Reddit loved it so much, though. Setsugekka creates a zen atmosphere and the barista tells you where they source their matcha from, shows you photos of the matcha fields, the farmers, and even tells you the person who took the photographs you're looking at! They also had a slideshow on a small TV showing some more photos of the matcha farm and matcha-making process. I appreciate it when places show appreciation & respect for every person who was part of the process of making their work possible, and I enjoyed seeing behind the curtain, so to speak, of the matcha making process.</p>
            <p>This place feels very fancy, and definately triggered my "politeness instincts" haha. I felt like I needed to fix my posture, speak quietly, and use proper table manners. I suddenly felt underdressed in my cargo pants and hoodie. Setsugekka is quite the fancy little matcha place from the zen music they play, to the intentional and practiced way the barista makes the matcha. I've never been to a matcha ceremony before, but I assume it's something like the experience Setsugekka provides.</p>
            <h3>Rating Explaination</h3>
            <p>Overall, this matcha is definitely not worth $10+. It tastes like a lot of the 3 star matchas I’ve rated, mostly because it's so watered down.</p>
            <p>I’ve only tried their Hana Matcha, however, I don't see a reason to go back and try the others when <a href="MatchaHouse_review.html">Matcha House</a> is only three blocks away from Setsugekka and their matcha is infinitely more potent and cheaper.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Wow.... This review was a long one. If you want more opinions on this place, I'd suggest checking their Yelp reviews. I feel like they painted a pretty acurate picture that was inline with my own experiences.</p>
