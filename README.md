<h1>Matcha Majesty</h1>
<h3><i>You're guide to the best Matcha in NYC & NJ!</i></h3>
<br>
<p>It's time to spill the tea on matcha! Since matcha's rise in popularity many places have tried to cash in on the hype. Unfortunately, most of these places never bothered to learn how to make a decent cup. After way too many bad matchas and bad recommendations from people who love the flavor of the syrup more than that of the matcha, I began rating matcha in the notes app on my phone. Now, these ratings are on this website for all to see!</p>

<p>This site is a constant WIP while I update it and review more matcha places. I'm constantly adding features and improvements.</p>
<p>Currently, I am working on giving visitors the ability to leave their own reviews under mine. I have already implemented this feature on localhost, but am struggling to figure out how to make it live.</p>
<p>For this site, I used the leaflet Open Streets map API to mark reviewed locations on a map. I've also stored review information in a JSON file and loaded the info into HTML using javaScript.</p>
<p>I've implemented a light and dark mode and utilized local storage to remember user preferences across pages.</p>
<p>Reviews can be sorted by star rating, price, and flavor, allowing for users to easily find what they're looking for, whether that be the worst matcha known to man or the best.</p>
<p>I have learned a lot while making this site and continue to learn as I get inspired to add new features.</p>
