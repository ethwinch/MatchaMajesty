<h1>Matcha Majesty</h1>
<h3><i>You're guide to the best Matcha in NYC & NJ!</i></h3>
<br>
<p>It's time to spill the tea on matcha! Since matcha's rise in popularity many places have tried to cash in on the hype. Unfortunately, most of these places never bothered to learn how to make a decent cup. After way too many bad matchas and bad recommendations from people who love the flavor of the syrup more than that of the matcha, I began rating matcha in the notes app on my phone. Now, these ratings are on this website for all to see!</p>

<p>This site is a constant WIP while I add new features and review more matcha places.</p>
<b>Features:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Uses leaflet Open Streets map API to mark reviewed locations on a map.</li>
  <li>Review and location details stored in a JSON file and loaded into HTML via javaScript.</li>
  <li>Light & Dark mode and utilization of localStorage to remember user preference across pages.</li>
  <li>Filtering system on reviews which can be filtered by star rating, price, and flavor.</li>
  <li>Unique logo drawn by me :)</li>
</ul>
<b>UPCOMING FEATURES!</b>
<ul>
  <li>Ability for visitors to leave their own reviews under my own. Comments will be stored in a MySQL database and store information such as page_id, display_name, and comment.</li>
  <li>Implementing page ID system to make it easier to display review comments based on current page.</li>
  <li>Ensuring proper defenses against XSS and SQL Injections by using prepared statements and santitization.</li>
</ul>

<p>This site is a passion project of mine that gets updated as I think of new features or review new places.</p>
